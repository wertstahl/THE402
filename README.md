# THE402<br>
- A Cyberpunk-Industrial Loop-Player
A new model of an electronic music loops experience, in JavaScript (and HTML5).<br>

## Credits
code and <a href="https://github.com/regosen/Gapless-5">Gapless-5 library</a>: Rego Sen<br>
concept and design: Sebastian I. Hartmann<br>
content: S.I. Hartmann, S. Sippel<br>
## What
An endless album in random order,<br>
consisting of 402 parts, playable on all<br>
devices and platforms, no additional<br>
software or installation required, free of charge.<br>
<br>
Total playtime: one session lasts somewhere<br>
between 45 minutes and up to 8 hours until the<br>
first 'repetition' occurs.<br>
<br>
The parts (loops) have been specially designed by <br>
two dedicated electronic-industrial music artists <br>
over the span of 12 years. Code was assembled by <br>
the creator of the Gapless JS/HTML5 library. <br>

## Features
All loops are seamlessly fitted and looped on the fly,<br>
the number of repeats is random or user-interacted.<br>
An experience much broader and more individual<br>
as would be with a classic fixed-tracks-album.<br>
On- or Offline usage is optional. Usage is free of charge.<br>
<br>
<i>Notice: be aware that mobile use might generate some traffic<br>
on your device. Probably 64MB/h on low quality (or about 470MB in total).<br>
In comparison, one hour of 720p youtube video generates 1,5GB of traffic.</i><br>

## FAQ

Anshwer: If it was easy to do in JS, it would have been implemented.<br>
Technical Anshwer: WebAudio API doesn't preserve pitch when affecting playback rate.<br>
Shurprise: There are swift transitions now. Coder's Magic!<br>
