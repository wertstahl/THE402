What?<br>
<br>
An endless album in random order,<br>
consisting of 402 parts, playable on all<br>
devices and platforms, no additional<br>
software or installation required, free.<br>
<br>
The parts (loops) have been specially designed by <br>
two dedicated artists over the span of 10 years.<br>
<br>
Features?<br>
<br>
All loops are seamlessly fitted and looped on the fly,<br>
the number of repeats is random or user-interacted.<br>
An experience much broader and more individual<br>
as would be with a classic fixed-tracks-album.<br>
<br>
On-Line or Offline usage is optional. Partial use is<br>
welcomed, after written permission. <br>
