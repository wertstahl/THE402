What?

An endless album in random order,
consisting of 402 parts, playable on all
devices and platforms, no additional
software or installation required, free.

The parts (loops) have been specially designed by 
two dedicated artists over the span of 10 years.

Features?

All loops are seamlessly fitted and looped on the fly,
the number of repeats is random or user-interacted.
An experience much broader and more individual
as would be with a classic fixed-tracks-album.

On-Line or Offline usage is optional. Partial use is 
welcomed, after written permission.
