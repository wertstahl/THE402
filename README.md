<br>
<br>
<b>What?</b><br>
An endless album in random order,<br>
consisting of 402 parts, playable on all<br>
devices and platforms, no additional<br>
software or installation required, free.<br>
<br>
The parts (loops) have been specially designed by <br>
two dedicated electronic-industrial music artists <br>
over the span of 12 years. Code was assembled by <br>
the creator of the Gapless JS/HTML5 library. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Features?</b><br>
All loops are seamlessly fitted and looped on the fly,<br>
the number of repeats is random or user-interacted.<br>
An experience much broader and more individual<br>
as would be with a classic fixed-tracks-album.<br>
On- or Offline usage is optional. Usage is free.<br>
