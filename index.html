      					<code>A cyberpunk-industrial loop player V1.0</code>
      	</center>
      	
      	<h2>Backstory</h2>
				<p>
        	In 2006, deDokter (S. Sippel) and ws (S.I. Hartmann) were working on the songs for <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/558160-Wertstahl" style="color:darkslategrey;" target="_blank">Wertstahl</a>'s 2009-released electro-industrial album "kontrol".
					It was a time when the now dead <i>Adobe Flash</i> was a source of not only general disapproval but also lots of fun,
					in the form of a flood of games and looped content. <br>
					Since ws got an Amiga in 1988, he was, as a musician already very deeply invested in the concept of looping audio.
					Working in FL Studio from 2003, making loop-segments and later unfolding them
					into a full track, was standard practice for us. <br>
					<br>
					Ws comes from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene" target="_blank"><u>demoscene</u></a> background and enjoys participating in competitions, so one day we decided 
					to make a series of loops no longer than 10 seconds, via email in a ping-pong-communication fashion: 
					one does a loop, the other reacts and replies to it with an even more interesting loop.
					Since it was just free experimenting, we enjoyed the process very much. We even decided to discard the project files
					so that all results were final.<br>
					As we had reached the 100 loops mark, it was obvious for us ... to do 100 more. Just to have 200 loops.<br>
					And after we had 200 loops we liked the result very much but had no exact solution how to deal with them.
					Bury them on just another old-fashioned linear album?<br>
					We chose to avoid problem thinking and instead went to do what every sane person would do: make 200 more! 
					So, we started in 2008 and suddenly, 11 years later, we had 402 loops, 
					which is because of a slight miscalculaton due to us going through the numbers backwards, but still no solution in sight
					for an idea that came up while we were in the process of creating them. <br>
					<br>
			  </p>
	 			<h2>The idea: try a new way <br>
				<p>
	 				So we have an endless, random album of building blocks (loops) that will each be played
					for a random amount of time and there is limited user interaction. 
					The effect of this is, that there is no dynamic arc that anyone could get used to.
					There will be no imprint of the listener onto the music, since the story is always a bit different.
					Therefore, this player could be either very meditative or feel like you have been visiting 
					a funfair, with all of it's chaotic impressions.<br>
				  Test showed, an excellent usecase is listening to it while doing (outdoor) sports.<br>
					Although there is quite some structure and order in this player, chaos is the main factor
					of the overall experience. Infact it is a chaotic cyberpunk-industrial music setting. <br><br>
					With the kind help of Rego Sen, The402 is now a neat loop-player that runs on virtually every 
					device that has a javascript-capable browser installed.
					We hope you enjoy our content and find it funny and inspiring, energizing yet relaxing.<br>
					<br>
					The402 is completely free to use. Except for any caused mobile traffic on your side, ofcourse. The size for all loops in
		      normal quality audio setting is just about 64MB, only slightly larger than an email attachent from your boss.<br>
					<br>
					In case you like one or more loops so much, you would want to use it in your social media video or even as part of your song,
					you can download them - our terms are: send us a mail to info@battlecommand.org to get written permission of usage.
					There will be no fees from our side for non-commercial use. We only need to make sure that
					third parties won't monetize our work. No mail: no permission of re-use. <br>
	 			  <br>
	 			</p>
				
				<h2>Controls</h2>
	 			<p>
					The loopdots in the upper right show you how many iterations this loop has left. <br>
          <br>					
					Skip back, Pause/Play, Skip forth -- work as usual in every player interface. <br>
					<br>
					The RND-Button cycles. It shows you how many random repeats a loop will have: <br>
					RND2/4 = minimum 2 maximum 4 repeats. Standard. <br>
					1 HOLD = plays the same loop over and over again. <br>
					RND (no numbers) = minimum 1 maximum 8 loops. For the extended experience. <br>
					X = no repeats, plays all loops once, straight through <br>
					<br>
					Share Loop: Copies the URL of the current loop to clipboard so that you can paste it into
					your messenger, email, whathaveyou <br>
				  <br>
					Download Loop: Download a mp3 or flac of the loop, accompained by a readme (license)
					(depending on which version of the player you launched) <br>
					<br>
					The yellow 402 / 201D / 201A filters are there for research purposes. 
					Although the list is <i>always</i> random, it can be divided into  <br>
					- All 402 loops <br>
					- All 201 loops by deDokter <br>
					- All 201 loops by ws<br>
					<br>
				</p>
				<h2>Parameters</h2>
				<p>
					The402 has some args, inkey$ you care:<br>
					<br>
					<code>
					--> quality = [low|high, default = low]<br>
					--> id = [ID of the loop, e.g. 397A]<br>
					--> mode = [rnd24, hold, rnd, off]<br>
					--> filter = [select1|select2|select3]<br>
					</code>
					<br>
					example link:<br>
					<br><code>
					https://the402.wertstahl.de/player/?quality=low&id=390D&mode=rnd24&filter=select1<br>
					</code><br>
					<br>
        </p>	
  			<h2>Good vs. bad glitches</h2>
      	<p>
					The402 is written in javascript, which heavily depends on the system it runs on.
					There are some issues we cannot work around: if you step in or out of your WLAN, or your 
					mobile connection gets interrupted - or you change from headphones to speakers or the other 
					way 'round, these are the moments, when your device takes full control. If you experience interruptions, 
					that is when you change networks, audio devices, or there	might be an issue with your provider.
					We are not informed of this, so glitches (silence) can happen. If it happens, please make sure
					you're properly connected to a network and audio is set up correctly, then simply reload The402.
					<br>
					If you want an entirely uninterruptible experience, feel free to download the standalone 
					version of The402 (also free).  <br> 
					<br>
					Best regards, enjoy!<br>
					<br>

					program ws wrote for the Commodore C64. It is available <a href="https://csdb.dk/release/?id=219510" target="_blank"><u>here.</u></a>
