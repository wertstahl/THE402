      	<center><h2>Welcome to The 402</h2>
      					<code> V0.6</code>
      	</center>
      	
      	<h2>Backstory</h2>
				<p>
        	In 2006, deDokter (S. Sippel) and ws (S.I. Hartmann) were working on the songs for <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/558160-Wertstahl" style="color:darkslategrey;" target="_blank">Wertstahl</a>'s 2009-released electro-industrial album "kontrol".
					It was a time when the internet was already beyond xxx to use and lots of things were possible.
					Also, the now dead flash was a source of not only general disapproval but also lots of fun,
					in the form of a flood of games and looped content. <br>
					Since ws got an Amiga in 1988, he was, as a musician obviously already very deeply invested in the looping concept,
					which should be easy to understand for anybody who has ever worked with digital audio.
					Since from 2003 we worked in FL Studio, making loop-segments and later unfolding them
					into a full track was a normal practice for us. <br>
					<br>
					One day we decided to just make a bunch of loops no longer than 10 seconds. 
					Ws comes from a demoscene background and enjoys competitions and challenges between partners.
					Why not do it in a ping-pong-communication fashion: one does a loop, the other reacts to it and makes another loop.
					Since it was just freely experimenting, we enjoyed the process very much. Originally we even said to discard the project files
					so that all thats left are only the loop wavs.<br>
					And all of a sudden we had 100 loops ready, so it was obvious for us ... to do 100 more. Just to have 200 loops.<br>
					And after we had 200 loops we liked the result very much but had no exact idea what to do with it.
					Shove them on just another boring linear album? Take the fun out of just grabbing into the box, and playing a bunch of Legos?<br>
					With that in mind, we decided to avoid problem thinking and instead went to do what every sane person would do - exactly: make 200 more! 
					Which probably took two more years to finish.  <br>
					So, we started in 2008 and suddenly 11 years later in 2019 we had 402 loops, 
					because of a miscalculaton due to the strange way of going through the numbers (backwards). And still no solution in sight,
					for the idea that had emerged while we made the loops. <br>
					<br>
			  </p>
	 			<h2>The idea: break with traditions <br>
				<p>
	 				So we have an endless, random album of building blocks (loops) that will each be played
					for a random amount of time and there is limited user interaction. 
					The effect of this is, that there is no dynamic arc that anyone could get used to.
					There will be no imprint of the listener onto the music, since the story is always a bit different.
					Therefore, this player could be either very meditative or feel like you have been visiting 
					a funfair, with all of it's chaotic impressions.<br>
				  Test showed, usecase is also excellent for planning or outdoor sports.<br>
					Although there is quite some structure and order in this player, chaos is the main factor
					of the overall experience. Let's put that even clearer: it is a chaotic industrial music setting. <br><br>
					I personally like the fact that this (with the kind help of Rego Sen) is now a fully functional
					player that runs on virtually every device that has a javascript-capable browser on int.
					We hope you enjoy the - sometimes really whack and stressy - content and find it funny and inspiring,
					energizing or relaxing.  <br>
					And if you like a loop so much, you would want to use it in your social media video or even as part of your song,
					feel free to download the flac version. BUT! please send us a mail beforehand, 
					before you release any of it! There will be no fee from our side, but we need to make sure that
					certain people refrain from making money off of our work. Especially if someone tries to drag the loops into a
					copyright-licensing-pit like content-ID, that is where we will take legal action. <br>

	 			<h2>Idea in depth: intention</h2>
	 			<p>
 				   Whenever we listen to an Album, a premeditated playlist, enjoy a movie or attend a play, someone 
 				   has set an arc of suspense, expectations are involved, the mind is ready to record emotions and connect them
 				   to the stream of experience. It is an important Brain mechanism to have an internal map of the world with how to get there, what are the 
 				   dangers, what are incentives and what are the pleasures. This stream of experience and emotions will then be processed by the brain and 
 				   will enter the long-term memory. At a later time, you are roaming the streets, have your favourite album playing along, 
 				   and you may experience intense emotions again which were burnt into your memory. Which will become an almost immutable part of 
 				   your personality. Whenever a certain song plays, whenever you put a certain album on, or watch a movie that you 
 				   might have seen while you experienced key moments of your emotional existence, those memories will be recalled. 
 				   Wether you like it, or not. It is an uncontrollable mechanism. The media is now laden with your emotions. Deep ones.<br>
 				   <br>
 				   This happens, unless you remove the mechanism itself.<br>
 				   <br> 
 				   Ws talked to quite some people who mostly enjoy taking trips back into time by listening to old music the had fond memories imprinted on.<br>
 				   But there were also those, who had several very beautiful art ruined for them, because they experienced something terrible or unpleasant.<br>
 				   Studies have shown, that The 402 interrupts the inevitable emotional resurfacing of memories by breaking the concept of the arc 
 				   of suspense and suppressing a story pattern, which is needed by the mechanisms of the brain to associate emotions with certain streams of information.<br>
 				   The connections between the elements in The 402 span over an usual long timespan, that at first one
 				   might not feel a correlation between all the parts. The unheard element of The 402 is a production span, that 
 				   exceeds the lifespan of many trends, more than two actual generations, is completely non-political and free from memes or media 
 				   flavor. Also, it is (real) random* everytime: the playlist is randomized upon loading the player.<br>
 				   So to try and get into a feeling for the experience, in an oldfashioned way you would have to listen to it about 88 hours non-stop.<br>
 				   <br>
 				   <code>(*"random everytime" means, that the order is completely random, you wont hear any tune twice until you heard all 402 or 201 loops)</code><br>
 				   We believe, that is a wide enough overhead to safely assume, that the experience can only be ruined by difficult taste.
 				   Whenever you return to The 402, it will not be like before and in unpredictable disorder.<br>
 				   <br>
 				   If that is not enough, you simply interact. By pushing the buttons. <br>
 				   <br>
				</p>				
				
				<h2>Controls</h2>
	 			<p>
					The loopdots in the upper right show you how many iterations this loop has left. <br>
          <br>					
					Skip back, Pause/Play, Skip forth -- work as usual in every player interface. <br>
					<br>
					The RND-Button cycles. It shows you how many random repeats a loop will have: <br>
					RND2/4 = minimum 2 maximum 4 repeats. Standard. <br>
					1 HOLD = plays the same loop over and over again. <br>
					RND (no numbers) = minimum 1 maximum 8 loops. For the extended experience. <br>
					X = no repeats, plays all loops once, straight through <br>
					<br>
					Share Loop: Copies the URL of the current loop to clipboard so that you can paste it into
					your messenger, email, whathaveyou <br>
				  <br>
					Download Loop: Download a mp3 or flac of the loop, accompained by a readme (license)
					(depending on which version of the player you launched) <br>
					<br>
					The yellow 402 / 201D / 201A filters are there for research purposes. 
					Although the list is <i>always</i> random, it can be divided into  <br>
					- All 402 loops <br>
					- All 201 loops by deDokter <br>
					- All 201 loops by ws<br>
					<br>
				</p>
				<h2>Parameters</h2>
				<p>
					The 402 has some args, inkey$ you care:<br>
					<br>
					<code>
					--> startMode = [rnd24, hold, rnd, off]<br>
					--> id = [ID of the loop, e.g. 397A]<br>
					--> startFilter = [select1|select2|select3]<br>
					--> loadLimit = [max tracks in memory, default = 5]<br>
					--> quality = [low|high, default = low]<br>
					</code>
					<br>
					example link:<br>
					<br><code>
					https://the402.wertstahl.de/player/?loopRange=2,4&id=082A&startMode=rnd24&filter=select1<br>
					</code><br>
					<br>
        </p>	
  			<h2>Talk about bugs</h2>
      	<p>
					No matter how perfect we try to be, the system just won't keep up.
					There are some issues we cannot work around: if you step in or out of your WLAN, or your 
					mobile connection gets interrupted - or you change from headphones to speakers or the other 
					way 'round, these are the moments, when your device takes control.
					Which we are not informed of, because The 402 is designed to run on 
					all systems, in javascript, and relys on a browser and their hardware.<br>
					<br>
					So if you want a one hundred percent uninterrupted experience, please obtain the standalone 
					version.If you experience interruptions, that is when you change networks, audio devices, or there  
					might be an issue with your provider.  
					Probably 2022 still ain't ready for us yet.<br>
					<br>
					Best regards, enjoy!<br>
					<br>
