      	<h2>The Story of 402 loops 0.4</h2>
      	<p>
        	In 2006, deDokter and i were working on the tracks for our 2009-released album "kontrol".
					It was a time when the internet was already nice to use and lots of things were still possible.
					Also the now dead flash was a source of not only general disapproval but also lots of fun
					in the form of a flood of games and looped content. <br>
					Since i got my Amiga in 1988, i was obviously already very deeply invested in the looping concept,
					which should be easy to understand for everybody who has ever worked with digital audio.
					Since we worked in FL Studio, making "loops" of segments and later unfolding them
					into a full track was a normal practice for us.  <br>
					<br>
					One day we decided to just make a bunch of loops no longer than 10 seconds. 
					In a ping-pong-communication fashion: one does a loop, the other reacts to it and makes another loop.
					Since it was just freely experimenting, we enjoyed the process very much and all of a sudden 
					we had 100 loops rady, so it was obvious for us to do 100 more. Just to have 200 loops.
					And after we had 200 loops we liked the result very much but had no clue what to do with it.
					With that in mind, we decided to do what every sane person would do - exactly: 200 more! 
					Which probably two more years to finish.  <br>
					So, started in 2009 and suddenly 10 years later in 2019 we had 402 loops 
					(by a miscalculaton due to the strange way of going through the numbers) and still no solution
					for the idea that had emerged while we made the loops. <br>
					<br>
					The idea was as follows: <br>
					We have an endless, random album of building blocks (loops) that will each be played
					for a random number of time and there will be limited user interaction. 
					The effect of this is, that there is no dynamic arch that anyone could get used to.
					There will be no imprint of the listener onto the music, since the story is always a bit different.
					Therefore, this Player could be either very meditative or feel like you have been visiting 
					a funfair, with all of it's chaotic impressions.
					Although there is quite some structure and order in this player, chaos is the main factor
					of the overall experience. <br>
					I personally like the fact that this (with the kind help of Rego Sen) is now a fully functional
					player that runs on virtually evry device that has a javascript-capable browser on int.
					We hope you enjoy the - sometimes really whack and stressy - content funny and inspiring,
					energizing or relaxing.  <br>
					And if you like a loop so much, you would like to use it in your tiktok or youtube or even song,
					feel free to download the flac version -- but please send us a mail beforehand, 
					before you release any of it! There will be no fee from our side, but we need to make sure that
					certain people refrain from making money off of our work. <br>
	 			  <br>
	 			  <br>
					The Controls: <br>
					<br>
					The loopdots in the upper right show you how many iterations this loop has left. <br>
          <br>					
					Skip back, Pause/Play, Skip forth -- work as usual in every player interface. <br>
					<br>
					The RND-Button cycles. It shows you how many random repeats a loop will have: <br>
					RND2/4 = minimum 2 maximum 4 repeats. Standard. <br>
					1 HOLD = plays the same loop over and over again. <br>
					RND (no numbers) = minimum 1 maximum 8 loops. For the extended experience. <br>
					X = no repeats, plays all loops once, straight through <br>
					<br>
					Share Loop: Copies the URL of the current loop to clipboard so that you can paste it into
					your messenger, email, whathaveyou <br>
				  <br>
					Download Loop: Download a mp3 or flac of the loop, accompained by a readme (license)
					(depending on which version of the player you launched) <br>
					<br>
					The yellow 402 / 201D / 201A filters are there for research purposes.  <br>
					Although the list is *always* random, it can be divided into  <br>
					- All 402 loops <br>
					- All 201 loops by DeDokter <br>
					- All 201 loops by PSAUX (aka Wertstahl..) <br>
					<br>
					Thank you for reading this, <br>
					enjoy the chaos! <br>
					<br>
					best regards <br>
					Sebastian I. Hartmann aka Werstahl

					Known bug: sometimes chrome on android will leave the last iteration of loops quiet. 
					We went to great lenghts to investigate how this can be, but the best solution currently is
					to forgive us and just load the page again. If that still doesn't help, please try firefox on android.
					The bug doesn't happen there.
					If you find anything worth mentioning, feel free to contact us via info at battlecommand dot org.
